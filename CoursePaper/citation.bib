abstract = {Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have found many applications in industrial and in academic settings, which in turn, have motivated considerable research efforts towards large-scale information extraction from a variety of sources. Despite such efforts, it is well known that even the largest KGs suffer from incompleteness; Link Prediction (LP) techniques address this issue by identifying missing facts among entities already in the KG. Among the recent LP techniques, those based on KG embeddings have achieved very promising performance in some benchmarks. Despite the fast-growing literature on the subject, insufficient attention has been paid to the effect of the design choices in those methods. Moreover, the standard practice in this area is to report accuracy by aggregating over a large number of test facts in which some entities are vastly more represented than others; this allows LP methods to exhibit good results by just attending to structural properties that include such entities, while ignoring the remaining majority of the KG. This analysis provides a comprehensive comparison of embedding-based LP methods, extending the dimensions of analysis beyond what is commonly available in the literature. We experimentally compare the effectiveness and efficiency of 18 state-of-the-art methods, consider a rule-based baseline, and report detailed analysis over the most popular benchmarks in the literature.},

  Abstract = {&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt; Effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19 are urgently needed. Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug with in vitro and in vivo efficacy against coronaviruses. Here, we tested the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. &lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt; To evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 disease outcome, we used the recently established rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease. Two groups of six rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with intravenous remdesivir or an equal volume of vehicle solution once daily. Clinical, virological and histological parameters were assessed regularly during the study and at necropsy to determine treatment efficacy. &lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt; In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs. Virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages were significantly reduced as early as 12hrs after the first treatment was administered. At necropsy on day 7 after inoculation, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were significantly lower and there was a clear reduction in damage to the lung tissue. &lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt; Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection has a clear clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. These data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in COVID-19 patients to prevent progression to severe pneumonia.},

The intersection of multi-organ responses to alcohol-mediated tissue injury likely contributes to the modulation of lung in response to injury. Indeed, the negative impact of alcohol on susceptibility to infection and on lung barrier function is now well documented. Thus, the alcohol lung represents a very likely comorbidity for the negative consequences of both COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. In this review, we present the known alcohol misuse ramifications on the lung in the context of the current coronavirus pandemic.}

abstract = {Network embedding (or graph embedding) has been widely used in many real-world applications. However, existing methods mainly focus on networks with single-typed nodes/edges and cannot scale well to handle large networks. Many real-world networks consist of billions of nodes and edges of multiple types, and each node is associated with different attributes. In this paper, we formalize the problem of embedding learning for the Attributed Multiplex Heterogeneous Network and propose a unified framework to address this problem. The framework supports both transductive and inductive learning. We also give the theoretical analysis of the proposed framework, showing its connection with previous works and proving its better expressiveness. We conduct systematical evaluations for the proposed framework on four different genres of challenging datasets: Amazon, YouTube, Twitter, and Alibaba. Experimental results demonstrate that with the learned embeddings from the proposed framework, we can achieve statistically significant improvements (e.g., 5.99-28.23% lift by F1 scores; p&lt;&lt;0.01, t-test) over previous state-of-the-art methods for link prediction. The framework has also been successfully deployed on the recommendation system of a worldwide leading e-commerce company, Alibaba Group. Results of the offline A/B tests on product recommendation further confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework in practice.},

abstract = {Knowledge graphs have emerged as a key abstraction for organizing information in diverse domains and their embeddings are increasingly used to harness their information in various information retrieval and machine learning tasks. However, the ever growing size of knowledge graphs requires computationally efficient algorithms capable of scaling to graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges. This paper presents DGL-KE, an open-source package to efficiently compute knowledge graph embeddings. DGL-KE introduces various novel optimizations that accelerate training on knowledge graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges using multi-processing, multi-GPU, and distributed parallelism. These optimizations are designed to increase data locality, reduce communication overhead, overlap computations with memory accesses, and achieve high operation efficiency. Experiments on knowledge graphs consisting of over 86M nodes and 338M edges show that DGL-KE can compute embeddings in 100 minutes on an EC2 instance with 8 GPUs and 30 minutes on an EC2 cluster with 4 machines with 48 cores/machine. These results represent a 2\texttimes{} ~ 5\texttimes{} speedup over the best competing approaches. DGL-KE is available on https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-ke.},

abstract = {Ritonavir is a HIV protease inhibitor routinely prescribed to HIV patients that also potently inactivates cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4), the major human drug-metabolizing enzyme. By inhibiting CYP3A4, ritonavir increases plasma concentrations of other anti-HIV drugs oxidized by CYP3A4 thereby improving clinical efficacy. Despite the importance and wide use of ritonavir in anti-HIV therapy, the precise mechanism of CYP3A4 inhibition remains unclear. The available data are inconsistent and suggest that ritonavir acts as a mechanism-based, competitive or mixed competitive-noncompetitive CYP3A4 inactivator. To resolve this controversy and gain functional and structural insights into the mechanism of CYP3A4 inhibition, we investigated the ritonavir binding reaction by kinetic and equilibrium analysis, elucidated how the drug affects redox properties of the hemoprotein, and determined the 2.0\&nbsp;Å X-ray structure of the CYP3A4-ritonavir complex. Our results show that ritonavir is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase.}}

  Abstract = {&lt;h4&gt;Purpose&lt;/h4&gt;Ritonavir is a powerful inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) that metabolizes many antiretrovirals. We examined the effect of ritonavir and of chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) status on CYP3A activity.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Twenty-six HIV-positive men (13 with CVH, 16 on chronic ritonavir-based highly active antiretroviral therapy) received oral and intravenous midazolam, a probe for CYP3A phenotypic activity.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;CYP3A activity was expressed as oral clearance of the midazolam probe. In HIV-positive subjects not on ritonavir, CYP3A activity (mean +/- SD) did not differ between subjects by CVH (no CVH, controls: 28.5 +/- 9.0 vs. CVH+: 23.2 +/- 6.2 mL/min/kg, not significant). In those on ritonavir (R), CYP3A activity was 7% of controls (R: 2.1 +/- 0.8 vs. no R 28.5 +/- 9.0 mL/min/kg, P &lt; 0.0004). CYP3A activity in subjects on ritonavir and with CVH was further reduced to 4% of controls (no CVH, R+ 2.1 +/- 0.8 vs. R+, CVH+ 1.0 +/- 0.4 mL/min/kg, P &lt; 0.006).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Ritonavir markedly decreases CYP3A activity. In the presence of CVH, ritonavir-based therapy further reduces CYP3A activity by half. Coinfection with CVH impairs CYP3A activity in the presence of the CYP3A inhibitor ritonavir.},
